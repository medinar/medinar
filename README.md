### Hi there, I'm Rommel ðŸ‘‹

I am a Backend Developer and I love learning and building new stuffs.
To be able to create more exciting software ðŸ”­ I am adding Devops and Frontend development skills to my repertoire.
ðŸŒ± So Iâ€™m currently in the process of learning React, Docker and AWS.

When I'm not coding I spend my time with my family. 
I love to watch movies, eat good food or go to the park with my wife and our kids.
