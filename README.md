### Hi there. I'm Rommel ðŸ‘‹

I am a Backend Developer and I love learning new stuffs.
ðŸ”­ I want to develop my Devops and Frontend development skills to add to my repertoire.
ðŸŒ± So Iâ€™m currently learning React, Docker and AWS.

When I'm not coding I spend my time with my family watching TV or going to the park with my kids.
